# Executive Summary
The dataset, initially comprising 20640 rows and 10 features, underwent cleaning and extensive feature engineering, resulting in a robust 20640 rows and 16 features. Key findings include the successful imputation of missing 'total_bedrooms' values and the discovery of strong positive correlations between household and room counts, as well as a strong negative correlation between geographical coordinates. Several numeric features exhibit high skewness. The data is now prepared and scaled, making it suitable for immediate machine learning model development to predict `median_house_value`.

## Data Overview
- **Initial Shape:** (20640 rows, 10 columns)
- **Processed Shape:** (20640 rows, 16 columns)
- **Original Column Types:** 9 numeric (float64), 1 categorical (object).
- **Final Feature Types:** All 16 features are numeric after scaling and one-hot encoding.
- **Target Variable:** `median_house_value` (continuous numeric).
- **Original Numeric Columns:** `longitude`, `latitude`, `housing_median_age`, `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, `population`, `households`, `median_income`, `median_house_value`.
- **Original Categorical Columns:** `ocean_proximity` (5 unique values).
- **Derived Features:** `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `population_per_household`.

## Data Quality & Cleaning
- **Identified Issues:**
    - 207 missing values in the `total_bedrooms` numeric column.
    - No duplicate rows were found.
- **Cleaning Steps Applied:**
    - Missing numeric values in `total_bedrooms` were imputed using the median of the column.
    - Numeric features were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    - The categorical feature `ocean_proximity` was one-hot encoded using `pd.get_dummies()`.
    - Three new derived features (`rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `population_per_household`) were calculated and subsequently scaled.
- **Resulting DataFrame:** `df_features` (shape: 20640, 16) is clean and preprocessed.

## Key Findings
- **Top Absolute Correlations (from `df_features`):**
    - `households` and `total_bedrooms`: 0.9744 (Strong positive linear relationship).
    - `total_rooms` and `total_bedrooms`: 0.9271 (Strong positive linear relationship).
    - `latitude` and `longitude`: -0.9247 (Strong negative linear relationship, indicating a geographical pattern).
- **Important Target Variable Correlation:**
    - `median_income` shows a strong positive correlation with `median_house_value` (0.688075).
- **Highly Skewed Features:**
    - `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, `population`, `households`, `median_income`, `median_house_value`, `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `population_per_household` exhibit high skewness, potentially indicating the presence of outliers or non-normal distributions.
- **Population Density Insights:** `population_per_household` has a relatively low correlation with other features, suggesting it captures a unique aspect of the data.

## Statistical Results
- **Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk or similar for `longitude`):**
    - **Variable:** `longitude`
    - **p-value:** 0.0000
    - **Interpretation:** The p-value being less than 0.05 indicates that the null hypothesis of normality for `longitude` is rejected. `longitude` is not normally distributed.
- **Correlation Test (Pearson R for `longitude` vs `latitude`):**
    - **Variables:** `longitude` and `latitude`
    - **Correlation Coefficient (r):** -0.9247
    - **p-value:** 0.0000
    - **Interpretation:** A very strong, statistically significant negative linear correlation exists between `longitude` and `latitude`. This suggests that as `longitude` increases (moving east), `latitude` tends to decrease (moving south) across the dataset's geographical spread.
- **Group Comparison Test:**
    - The analysis indicates "Not enough categorical or numeric columns" for the specific group comparison test executed.

## Recommendations
- **Model Selection:** Given the regression task, consider applying various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Ridge/Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), and Neural Networks.
- **Outlier Analysis and Treatment:** Further investigate the highly skewed features for significant outliers, as these could unduly influence model training. Depending on the model, techniques likeWinsorization, robust scaling, or transformation (e.g., log, square root) might be beneficial.
- **Feature Importance:** After initial model training, utilize feature importance techniques (e.g., from tree-based models or permutation importance) to identify the most impactful features for `median_house_value` prediction.
- **Cross-Validation Strategy:** Implement robust cross-validation (e.g., K-Fold cross-validation) to ensure model generalization and prevent overfitting during training and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Geospatial Feature Engineering:** Given the strong `latitude`-`longitude` correlation and `ocean_proximity` categories, explore more advanced geospatial features or clustering to capture regional patterns in housing values.
