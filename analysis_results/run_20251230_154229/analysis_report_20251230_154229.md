# Executive Summary

This report summarizes the data preparation and exploratory data analysis of a housing dataset, focusing on factors influencing property prices. The initial dataset contained 545 entries with 13 features, without any missing values or duplicate rows. Key transformations included deriving new features, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The analysis revealed strong positive correlations between price and area, as well as between price and the presence of luxury amenities. Furnishing status also proved to be a significant predictor of property value.

## Data

The raw dataset, `df_raw`, comprised 545 observations and 13 variables.
- **Dimensions**: (545 rows, 13 columns).
- **Data Types**: The dataset contained 6 integer (`int64`) columns (e.g., `price`, `area`, `bedrooms`) and 7 object (`object`) columns (e.g., `mainroad`, `furnishingstatus`).
- **Missing Values**: No missing values were identified across any column.
- **Duplicate Rows**: No duplicate rows were found in the dataset.
- **Numeric Ranges**:
    - `price`: 1,750,000 to 13,300,000
    - `area`: 1,650 to 16,200
    - `bedrooms`: 1 to 6
    - `bathrooms`: 1 to 4
    - `stories`: 1 to 4
    - `parking`: 0 to 3
- **Categorical Uniqueness**: Binary object columns (`mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`) and `furnishingstatus` (3 unique values) were noted for potential encoding.

## Cleaning

The cleaning process, starting with `df_clean` initialized from `df_raw`, focused on maintaining data integrity given the initial quality.
- **Missing Values**: No missing values were present, thus no imputation or row/column removal was required.
- **Duplicate Rows**: The absence of duplicate rows meant no rows were dropped.
- **Outlier Handling**: Outlier capping was not performed as the initial validation indicated no range issues for numeric columns.
- **Row Dropping**: No rows were dropped due to excessive missing values (e.g., >50%) because no missing data existed.
- **Final State**: The `df_clean` retained its original shape of (545, 13) after these checks, confirming the initial high quality of the raw data.

## EDA

The exploratory data analysis involved significant feature engineering and data transformation.
- **Derived Features**:
    - `area_per_room`: Calculated as `area / (bedrooms + bathrooms)`.
    - `price_per_sq_unit`: Calculated as `price / area`.
    - `has_luxury_amenities`: A composite score derived from the sum of encoded `airconditioning`, `guestroom`, `hotwaterheating`, `prefarea`, and `basement`.
- **Encoding**:
    - Binary categorical features (`mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`) were binary encoded (yes:1, no:0).
    - `furnishingstatus` was label encoded (furnished:2, semi-furnished:1, unfurnished:0).
- **Scaling**: All numerical columns (`price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`, `area_per_room`, `price_per_sq_unit`) were MinMax scaled to a range between 0 and 1.
- **Descriptive Statistics (Scaled Features)**:
    - `price`: Mean=0.261, Std=0.162
    - `area`: Mean=0.241, Std=0.149
    - `bedrooms`: Mean=0.393, Std=0.148
    - `bathrooms`: Mean=0.095, Std=0.167
    - `stories`: Mean=0.269, Std=0.289
    - `area_per_room`: Mean=0.230, Std=0.139
    - `price_per_sq_unit`: Mean=0.305, Std=0.146
    - `has_luxury_amenities`: Mean=0.281, Std=0.271
- **Visualizations**: Distribution plots for `price` and `area`, a correlation heatmap, and a price boxplot were used to explore data characteristics and relationships.

## Statistics

- **Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk for `price`)**:
    - The p-value for the `price` column was 0.0000.
    - **Interpretation**: This low p-value (p < 0.05) indicates that the normalized property price data is not normally distributed.

## Key Insights

- **Primary Price Drivers**: There is a strong positive correlation between `price` and `area` (0.536), indicating larger properties are significantly more expensive. Similarly, `has_luxury_amenities` shows a strong positive correlation with `price` (0.514), highlighting the value consumers place on additional features.
- **Furnishing Status Impact**: Furnishing status significantly influences price, with furnished properties having the highest average prices (scaled average of 0.324), followed by semi-furnished (0.273) and unfurnished (0.196). The correlation is 0.305.
- **Price Variability**: The `price_per_sq_unit` exhibits considerable variability (Std=0.146 relative to Mean=0.305), suggesting that factors beyond mere size, such as location and specific amenities, play a crucial role in determining value per unit area.
- **Non-Normal Distribution**: The non-normal distribution of `price` suggests that linear models might require data transformation or alternative modeling approaches (e.g., robust regression, tree-based models) to ensure valid inferences.
