I need to extract high-value tokens from the provided context, focusing on data insights and ignoring code/logs. I will structure the information into the required markdown sections: Executive Summary, Data Overview, Data Quality & Cleaning, Key Findings, Statistical Results, and Recommendations.

Here's my plan:
1.  **Executive Summary**: Summarize the dataset, its quality, key relationships, and readiness for ML.
2.  **Data Overview**: Extract the shape, column types (numeric/categorical), and ranges.
3.  **Data Quality & Cleaning**: Note the absence of missing values and duplicates, and the transformations applied (scaling, one-hot encoding, feature engineering).
4.  **Key Findings**: List top correlations, distribution insights from charts (implicitly), and derived features.
5.  **Statistical Results**: Detail the normality test for 'price' and the correlation test between 'price' and 'area', including p-values and interpretations.
6.  **Recommendations**: Suggest next steps for model building.

I will ensure to only use information from the "EXTRACT ONLY" list and avoid any "IGNORE" items.# Executive Summary
The dataset, comprising 545 entries and 13 initial features, is clean with no missing values or duplicates, making it immediately ready for analysis. Key transformations included scaling numeric features, one-hot encoding categorical variables, and engineering two new features. Initial analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between 'price' and 'area', as well as significant relationships involving derived features. The 'price' distribution is non-normal.

## Data Overview
*   **Dataset Shape**: (545, 13) initially, expanded to (545, 16) after feature engineering and encoding.
*   **Initial Column Types**:
    *   **Numeric**: 'price', 'area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', 'parking'
    *   **Categorical**: 'mainroad', 'guestroom', 'basement', 'hotwaterheating', 'airconditioning', 'prefarea', 'furnishingstatus'
*   **Target Variable**: 'price' (identified as the primary numeric variable for analysis).
*   **Numeric Column Ranges**:
    *   price: [1,750,000, 13,300,000]
    *   area: [1,650, 16,200]
    *   bedrooms: [1, 6]
    *   bathrooms: [1, 4]
    *   stories: [1, 4]
    *   parking: [0, 3]

## Data Quality & Cleaning
*   **Missing Values**: None detected across any columns.
*   **Duplicates**: 0 duplicate rows found.
*   **Resolution**: No significant quality issues requiring imputation or removal were identified.
*   **Transformations Applied**:
    *   Numeric columns ('price', 'area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', 'parking') were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    *   Categorical columns were converted into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding (`pd.get_dummies`).
    *   Two new derived features were created: "area_per_bedroom" and "bath_bed_ratio".

## Key Findings
*   **Strong Positive Correlations**:
    *   'area' and 'area_per_bedroom' (0.748892)
    *   'bathrooms' and 'bath_bed_ratio' (0.709583)
    *   'price' and 'area' (0.535997)
*   **Moderate Positive Correlations with Price**:
    *   'price' and 'bathrooms' (0.517545)
    *   'price' and 'stories' (0.420712)
    *   'price' and 'parking' (0.384394)
    *   'price' and 'bedrooms' (0.366494)
    *   'price' and 'area_per_bedroom' (0.363855)
    *   'price' and 'bath_bed_ratio' (0.331515)
*   **Minimal/Negligible Correlations**: 'bedrooms' and 'bath_bed_ratio', 'bedrooms' and 'area_per_bedroom' show correlations very close to zero, indicating these derived features are orthogonal to 'bedrooms' in a linear sense.
*   **Visualizations Generated**:
    *   Histogram with KDE for 'price' distribution.
    *   Correlation Heatmap for all numeric columns.
    *   Box Plots for 'price', 'area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories' to detect outliers.

## Statistical Results
*   **Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk) for 'price'**:
    *   Statistic = 0.9216
    *   p-value = 0.0000
    *   **Interpretation**: The null hypothesis of normality for 'price' is rejected, indicating that the 'price' data is likely not normally distributed.
*   **Pearson Correlation Test ('price' vs 'area')**:
    *   Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.5360
    *   p-value = 0.0000
    *   **Interpretation**: The null hypothesis of no linear correlation is rejected. There is a statistically significant positive linear correlation between house 'price' and 'area'.

## Recommendations
*   Proceed with ML model development utilizing the preprocessed and engineered features.
*   Consider tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) that are robust to non-normal distributions and can capture complex non-linear relationships, especially given the non-normal 'price' distribution.
*   Explore feature importance analysis after initial model training to refine the feature set.
*   Further investigate the features highly correlated with 'price' ('area', 'bathrooms', 'stories', 'parking', 'bedrooms', 'area_per_bedroom', 'bath_bed_ratio') for their predictive power.
