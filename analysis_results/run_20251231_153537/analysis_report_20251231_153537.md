# Executive Summary
The dataset, comprising 545 entries with 13 original features, has been thoroughly cleaned, transformed, and augmented with two new features, bringing the total to 16. Key findings indicate a strong positive correlation between housing price and features like area, number of bathrooms, and the presence of amenities. The data is now scaled, encoded, and ready for machine learning model training, with particular attention to be paid to the non-normal distribution of the target variable, price.

## Data Overview
The initial dataset `df_raw` contained 545 rows and 13 columns. Following preparation, the `df_features` DataFrame consists of 545 rows and 16 columns. The original dataset included numeric features such as 'price' (target variable), 'area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', and 'parking', along with categorical features like 'mainroad', 'guestroom', 'basement', 'hotwaterheating', 'airconditioning', 'prefarea', and 'furnishingstatus'. Two new features, `area_per_bedroom` and `has_amenities`, were engineered. All categorical features were one-hot encoded, and numeric features were scaled.

## Data Quality & Cleaning
Initial data quality inspection revealed no missing values across any columns and no duplicate rows. All numeric ranges were logical, and categorical columns contained expected unique values.
The cleaning and preparation steps applied were:
*   A clean copy, `df_clean`, was created.
*   Numeric features were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
*   Categorical features were one-hot encoded using `pd.get_dummies()`.
*   Two new features, `area_per_bedroom` and `has_amenities`, were engineered.
*   The `df_features` DataFrame was constructed with these transformed and new features.

## Key Findings
*   **Strong Positive Correlations with Price:**
    *   `area`: 0.5360
    *   `bathrooms`: 0.5175
    *   `has_amenities`: 0.4623
    *   `airconditioning_yes`: 0.4530
*   **Other Significant Correlations:**
    *   `area` and `area_per_bedroom`: 0.7489 (very strong positive)
    *   `basement_yes` and `has_amenities`: 0.7122 (strong positive)
    *   `guestroom_yes` and `has_amenities`: 0.6897 (strong positive)
*   **General Patterns:** Larger areas, more bathrooms, and the presence of amenities like air conditioning, guest rooms, and basements are associated with higher prices.
*   **Anomalies:** The distribution of `price` is not normal (p-value = 0.0000). The engineered feature `area_per_bedroom` exhibits a wide range, suggesting potential outliers or skewness.

## Statistical Results
*   **Normality Test (for `price`):**
    *   Variable: `price`
    *   p-value: 0.0000
    *   Interpretation: The p-value being less than 0.05 indicates that the distribution of `price` is significantly non-normal.
*   **Correlation Test (Pearson, for `price` vs `area`):**
    *   Variables: `price` and `area`
    *   Correlation coefficient (r): 0.5360
    *   p-value: 0.0000
    *   Interpretation: There is a statistically significant moderate positive linear relationship between `price` and `area`.

## Recommendations
*   **Model Selection:** Given the non-normal distribution of the target variable (`price`), consider robust regression models or tree-based algorithms which are less sensitive to such distributions and potential outliers.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Further exploration of non-linear relationships or interaction terms between highly correlated features, such as `area` and `area_per_bedroom`, could yield additional predictive power.
*   **Outlier Management:** Investigate outliers, particularly in `area_per_bedroom` and other numeric features identified by box plots, to determine if they are data entry errors or extreme legitimate values that require specific handling (e.g., winsorization, robust scaling).
*   **Feature Importance Analysis:** Post-modeling, conduct a thorough feature importance analysis to identify the most impactful features for price prediction and potentially simplify the model by removing less significant ones.
