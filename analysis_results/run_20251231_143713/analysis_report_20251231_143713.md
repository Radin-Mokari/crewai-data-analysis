# Executive Summary
The dataset comprises 545 observations and 13 initial features related to housing prices, which were expanded to 15 features after transformation. Data quality was high, with no missing values or duplicates, allowing for direct feature engineering and scaling. Key findings reveal a strong positive correlation between house price and several features like area, bathrooms, and bedrooms, with the 'price' variable showing a non-normal distribution. The data is now clean and transformed, making it well-prepared for machine learning model development.

## Data Overview
*   **Initial Shape**: (545 rows, 13 columns)
*   **Final Shape (after transformations)**: (545 rows, 15 columns)
*   **Columns**:
    *   **Original Numeric**: `price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`
    *   **Original Categorical**: `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`
    *   **Transformed/Derived**: Categorical columns were one-hot encoded (e.g., `mainroad_yes`, `guestroom_yes`, `basement_yes`, `hotwaterheating_yes`, `airconditioning_yes`, `prefarea_yes`, `furnishingstatus_semi-furnished`, `furnishingstatus_unfurnished`). A new numeric feature, `area_per_bedroom`, was created.
*   **Data Types**: Initially, a mix of integer (for numeric) and object (for categorical). After transformation, all features are numeric (float for scaled, int for one-hot encoded).
*   **Target Variable**: `price` (continuous integer, representing house price).

## Data Quality & Cleaning
*   **Initial Data Quality**: The raw dataset exhibited high quality, with no missing values detected across any columns and no duplicate rows identified.
*   **Cleaning Steps Applied**:
    *   No imputation for missing values was required.
    *   No duplicate rows were dropped.
*   **Feature Transformation Steps**:
    *   **Scaling**: Numeric features (`price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`) were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    *   **Encoding**: Categorical features (`mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`) were converted into numerical representations using One-Hot Encoding (`pd.get_dummies`) with `drop_first=True` to avoid multicollinearity.
    *   **Feature Engineering**: A new derived feature, `area_per_bedroom`, was created by dividing `area` by `bedrooms` (with a small constant added to the denominator to prevent division by zero).

## Key Findings
*   **Price Distribution**: The `price` variable exhibits a non-normal distribution, as indicated by a p-value of 0.0000 in the normality test. This suggests potential skewness or other deviations from a normal curve.
*   **Correlations with Price**:
    *   `price` shows a moderate to strong positive correlation with `area` (0.5360), `bathrooms` (0.5175), `bedrooms` (0.3665), `stories` (0.4207), and `parking` (0.3844).
    *   Presence of `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, and `prefarea` also positively correlate with `price`, albeit generally to a lesser extent than physical attributes.
*   **Feature Inter-Correlations**:
    *   The derived feature `area_per_bedroom` shows a high positive correlation with `area` (0.7489), indicating potential multicollinearity.
    *   `furnishingstatus_semi-furnished` and `furnishingstatus_unfurnished` also display a relatively high negative correlation (-0.5884), which is expected for one-hot encoded variables from the same original categorical feature.
*   **Outlier Detection**: Box plots were generated for the initial numeric columns (`price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`), which visually confirmed the presence of outliers in several distributions.
*   **Categorical Feature Distribution**: `mainroad_yes` is the most common feature, while `hotwaterheating_yes` is relatively rare.

## Statistical Results
*   **Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk or similar)**
    *   **Variable**: `price`
    *   **p-value**: 0.0000
    *   **Interpretation**: The low p-value (less than typical significance levels like 0.05) strongly suggests that the distribution of `price` is significantly different from a normal distribution.
*   **Correlation Test (Pearson Correlation)**
    *   **Variables**: `price` vs. `area`
    *   **Correlation Coefficient (r)**: 0.5360
    *   **p-value**: 0.0000
    *   **Interpretation**: There is a statistically significant (p < 0.001) and moderately strong positive linear relationship between house price and area. As the area of a house increases, its price tends to increase.

## Recommendations
*   **Target Variable Transformation**: Given the non-normal distribution of `price`, consider applying transformations (e.g., log transformation) if the chosen machine learning models assume normality or if model performance is sensitive to skewed targets.
*   **Multicollinearity Assessment**: Further investigate the high correlation between `area` and `area_per_bedroom`, and between the one-hot encoded `furnishingstatus` columns. Techniques like Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis should be employed, and feature selection or dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) may be necessary to mitigate multicollinearity, especially for linear models.
*   **Outlier Handling**: Evaluate the impact of identified outliers in numeric features on model performance. Consider strategies such as capping, trimming, or using robust models less sensitive to outliers.
*   **Model Selection**: Explore a range of machine learning models. Tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) are often robust to non-normal distributions and multicollinearity. Regularized linear models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) could also be considered to handle multicollinearity if a linear approach is preferred.
