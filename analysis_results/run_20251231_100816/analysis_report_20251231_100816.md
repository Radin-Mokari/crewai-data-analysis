I need to generate a concise markdown report based on the provided context, applying token stratification. This means I will filter out low-value tokens like code, execution logs, and raw dataframe prints, and only extract high-value insights such as dataset shape, data quality issues, statistical metrics, visualization paths, key patterns, and recommendations.

Here's a plan to construct the report:
1.  **Executive Summary**: Summarize the dataset, data quality, and key insights for ML readiness.
2.  **Data Overview**: Detail the initial and processed dataset shape and column types.
3.  **Data Quality & Cleaning**: Describe identified data quality issues (or lack thereof) and the data cleaning steps taken.
4.  **Key Findings**: Highlight significant correlations, distributions, and other observed patterns or anomalies.
5.  **Statistical Results**: Present the results of any statistical tests, including p-values and interpretations.
6.  **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for subsequent machine learning modeling.

I will ensure to adhere to the specified sections and formatting, using bullet points where appropriate, and keeping the language concise.

**Applying Token Stratification:**

*   **PREPARATION PHASE RESULTS**:
    *   `df_raw` shape: (545, 13)
    *   Columns: 13 (numeric: 6, categorical: 7)
    *   No missing values in numeric columns.
    *   No duplicate rows.
    *   Categorical columns `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea` have 2 unique values. `furnishingstatus` has 3 unique values.
    *   Ranges for numeric columns (price: 1.75M-13.3M, area: 1650-16200, etc.) are available.
*   **CLEANING PHASE RESULTS**:
    *   No missing values were found, so no imputation was performed.
    *   No duplicate rows were found, so none were dropped.
    *   `df_clean.shape` remains (545, 13).
*   **FEATURE ENGINEERING PHASE RESULTS**:
    *   `df_features` created as a copy of `df_clean`.
    *   **Scaling**: `StandardScaler` applied to all original numeric columns (`price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`).
    *   **Encoding**: `One-Hot Encoding` applied to all original categorical columns (`mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`). This transformed 7 categorical columns into 15 new numeric (binary) columns.
    *   No derived features were created (as 'Age' and 'Fare' were not in the dataset).
    *   `df_features.shape` changed to (545, 21).
    *   All columns are now numeric (21 numeric, 0 categorical).
*   **ANALYSIS PHASE RESULTS**:
    *   `df_features` shape: (545, 21). All columns are now numeric.
    *   **Descriptive Statistics**: Standard deviation for scaled numeric columns is ~1, mean is ~0. Original categorical columns transformed into binary (0/1) features, their means reflect the proportion of '1's.
    *   **Correlation Matrix**:
        *   `price` shows moderate positive correlation with `area` (0.536), `bathrooms` (0.518), and `stories` (0.421).
        *   `price` also shows positive correlation with `mainroad_yes` (0.297), `guestroom_yes` (0.255), and `airconditioning_yes` (not in 10x10 snippet, but expected from feature list).
        *   Strong negative correlations (absolute 1.0) exist between one-hot encoded pairs (e.g., `airconditioning_yes` and `airconditioning_no`), which is expected.
    *   **Visualizations Created**:
        1.  Distribution of `price` (histogram with KDE).
        2.  Correlation Heatmap.
        3.  Box Plots for `price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories` (for outlier detection).
    *   **Statistical Tests**:
        *   Normality Test (`price`): p-value = 0.0000. This indicates that `price` is not normally distributed.
        *   Correlation Test (`price` vs `area`): r = 0.5360, p-value = 0.0000. This confirms a significant positive linear relationship between `price` and `area`.

Now I will structure these extracted insights into the required markdown report format.# Executive Summary
The dataset, comprising 545 house listings with 13 features, underwent successful preprocessing with no missing values or duplicates found. All numeric features were Standard Scaled, and categorical features were One-Hot Encoded, resulting in a clean dataset of 21 numeric features for modeling. Key findings include strong positive correlations between `price` and `area`, `bathrooms`, and `stories`, alongside significant non-normality in the `price` distribution. The dataset is well-prepared for machine learning model development.

## Data Overview
The initial dataset `df_raw` contained 545 rows and 13 columns.
*   **Numeric Columns (6)**: `price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`.
*   **Categorical Columns (7)**: `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`.
After feature engineering, the dataset `df_features` has a shape of (545, 21) with all columns being numeric. The target variable is `price`.

## Data Quality & Cleaning
*   **Missing Values**: No missing values were found in any numeric or categorical columns.
*   **Duplicate Rows**: No duplicate rows were detected in the dataset.
*   **Outliers**: Box plots for `price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories` were generated to visualize potential outliers, though specific outlier remediation was not detailed in the provided context.
*   **Cleaning Steps Applied**:
    *   No imputation of missing values was necessary.
    *   No duplicate rows were dropped as none existed.

## Key Findings
*   **Feature Engineering**:
    *   All numeric features (`price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`) were successfully Standard Scaled.
    *   All categorical features were converted to numeric using One-Hot Encoding, resulting in 15 new binary features.
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Numeric columns (post-scaling) exhibit means close to 0 and standard deviations close to 1, as expected.
*   **Correlations**:
    *   `price` shows a moderate positive correlation with `area` (0.536), `bathrooms` (0.518), and `stories` (0.421).
    *   `price` also correlates positively with `mainroad_yes` (0.297), `guestroom_yes` (0.255), and implicitly with other positive property features like `airconditioning_yes` (as seen from feature list, though not in the 10x10 matrix snippet).
    *   As expected, one-hot encoded pairs (e.g., `airconditioning_yes` and `airconditioning_no`) show perfect absolute correlation of 1.0.
*   **Visualizations**:
    *   A histogram with KDE plot was generated for the distribution of `price`.
    *   A correlation heatmap was created to visualize relationships between all numeric features.
    *   Box plots were used for `price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories` for outlier detection.

## Statistical Results
*   **Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk or similar for `price`)**:
    *   Variable: `price`
    *   p-value: 0.0000
    *   Interpretation: The extremely low p-value indicates that the `price` distribution significantly deviates from a normal distribution. This suggests that transformation of the target variable might be beneficial for certain regression models.
*   **Correlation Test (Pearson for `price` vs `area`)**:
    *   Variables: `price` and `area`
    *   Correlation coefficient (r): 0.5360
    *   p-value: 0.0000
    *   Interpretation: There is a statistically significant moderate positive linear relationship between `price` and `area`.

## Recommendations
*   **Model Selection**: Given the non-normal distribution of `price`, consider models robust to non-normal errors (e.g., tree-based models) or apply a target variable transformation (e.g., log-transform) before training linear models.
*   **Feature Importance**: After initial modeling, analyze feature importances to identify the most influential factors impacting `price`.
*   **Outlier Treatment**: Further investigate and potentially treat outliers identified in box plots for `price` and `area` if they are deemed problematic for chosen models.
*   **Multicollinearity**: While one-hot encoded pairs have perfect negative correlation, it's expected and handled. Monitor for high multicollinearity among other independent features, especially for linear models, and consider PCA or feature selection if problematic.
