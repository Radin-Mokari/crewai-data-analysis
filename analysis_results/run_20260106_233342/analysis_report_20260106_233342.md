# Executive Summary
The dataset, comprising 545 entries and 13 features, has undergone thorough cleaning, scaling, and encoding, preparing it for machine learning tasks. Key findings indicate a strong positive correlation between housing price and features like area and number of bathrooms. The data is robust for model building, with no missing values or duplicates, and new interaction features have been successfully integrated.

## Data Overview
*   **Shape:** 545 rows, 13 columns.
*   **Column Types:** 6 numeric features (`price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`) and 7 categorical features (`mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`).
*   **Target Variable:** 'price' is the primary target variable, as indicated by its central role in correlation analysis.

## Data Quality & Cleaning
*   **Initial State:** The raw dataset `df_raw` exhibited no missing values or duplicate rows. All numeric columns had valid ranges, and categorical columns had limited, consistent unique values.
*   **Cleaning Process:**
    *   `df_clean` was created as a copy of `df_raw`.
    *   A robust imputation strategy using medians for numeric columns and modes for categorical columns was prepared, although not actively applied due to the absence of missing values.
    *   Duplicate rows were checked and removed, but none were found, preserving the original row count of 545.
*   **Feature Engineering and Transformation:**
    *   `df_features` was initialized from `df_clean`.
    *   Numeric features were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    *   Categorical features were transformed using one-hot encoding (`pd.get_dummies()`).
    *   Two new interaction features, `area_per_bedroom` and `bath_bed_ratio`, were created to potentially enhance predictive power.

## Key Findings
*   **Descriptive Statistics:**
    *   Original numeric features (e.g., `price`, `area`) are scaled with means close to 0 and standard deviations close to 1.
    *   Engineered features (`area_per_bedroom`, `bath_bed_ratio`) show broader ranges and standard deviations.
*   **Price Distribution:**
    *   Box plots suggest that `price`, `area`, `bathrooms`, and `stories` distributions might contain outliers and exhibit positive skewness.
*   **Correlations with Price:**
    *   `price` shows the strongest positive correlations with `area` (0.536), `bathrooms` (0.518), and `stories` (0.421).
    *   Presence of `mainroad`, `guestroom`, and `basement` (binary indicators) also positively correlate with `price`.
    *   `airconditioning` also appears to positively influence `price` based on violin plot observation.
*   **Feature Inter-Correlations:**
    *   High correlation between `area` and the engineered `area_per_bedroom` (0.749) indicates potential multicollinearity.
    *   `bathrooms` and `bath_bed_ratio` also show high correlation (0.710).
    *   `furnishingstatus_semi-furnished` and `furnishingstatus_unfurnished` show a strong negative correlation (-0.588), as expected from one-hot encoded categories.

## Statistical Results
*   **Normality Test (price):** The p-value of 0.0000 indicates that the 'price' variable is not normally distributed, rejecting the null hypothesis of normality.
*   **Correlation Test (price vs area):** A strong positive correlation (r=0.5360) was found between 'price' and 'area'. The p-value of 0.0000 signifies that this correlation is statistically significant.

## Recommendations
*   **Model Selection:** Proceed with machine learning model training, leveraging the clean, scaled, and encoded dataset.
*   **Multicollinearity Management:** Address potential multicollinearity, particularly between `area` and `area_per_bedroom`, and `bathrooms` and `bath_bed_ratio`, as it can affect model interpretability and stability. Techniques like VIF analysis or feature selection can be applied.
*   **Target Variable Transformation:** Consider transforming the 'price' variable (e.g., log transformation) if the chosen machine learning model assumes or benefits from normally distributed residuals.
*   **Outlier Treatment:** Investigate and potentially treat outliers identified in `price`, `area`, `bathrooms`, and `stories` if they negatively impact model performance.
*   **Further Feature Engineering:** Explore additional interaction terms or polynomial features based on insights gained from initial model performance.
