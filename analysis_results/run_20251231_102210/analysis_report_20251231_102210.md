# Executive Summary
This report summarizes the initial data analysis of a housing dataset comprising 545 entries and 13 original features, expanded to 16 features after engineering. The dataset is free of missing values and duplicates, and the features have been scaled and encoded, making the data ready for machine learning model development. Key findings include a moderate positive correlation between 'price' and 'area', and the identification of several highly inter-correlated features.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains 545 records and 13 original columns. After feature engineering, the dataset for analysis (`df_features`) has 545 rows and 16 columns.
- **Numeric Columns (original):** `price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`.
- **Categorical Columns (original):** `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`.
- **Target Variable:** `price`.

## Data Quality & Cleaning
- **Missing Values:** No missing values were identified across any columns in the raw dataset.
- **Duplicate Rows:** No duplicate rows were found in the raw dataset.
- **Cleaning Steps:**
    - The raw data was copied to `df_clean`, and no rows were dropped as no duplicates were found.
    - **Feature Engineering:**
        - Numeric columns (`price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`) were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
        - Categorical columns (`mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`) were transformed using One-Hot Encoding (`pd.get_dummies`) with `drop_first=True`.
        - Two new derived features were created: 'AreaPerOccupancyUnit' (area divided by sum of bedrooms and bathrooms) and 'BathroomBedroomRatio' (bathrooms divided by bedrooms).

## Key Findings
- **Price Distribution:** Property prices range from 1,750,000 to 13,300,000.
- **Area Distribution:** Property areas range from 1,650 to 16,200 square units.
- **Room Counts:** Bedrooms range from 1 to 6, bathrooms from 1 to 4, and stories from 1 to 4. Parking availability ranges from 0 to 3 spots.
- **Categorical Insights:**
    - A large majority of properties are located on a `mainroad` (468 out of 545).
    - Most properties do not have a `guestroom` (448), `basement` (354), or `hotwaterheating` (520).
    - `Airconditioning` is less common (172 properties have it, 373 do not).
    - Most properties are not in a `prefarea` (417).
    - `furnishingstatus` is distributed as: semi-furnished (227), unfurnished (178), and furnished (140).
- **Top Absolute Correlations:**
    1.  'area' and 'AreaPerOccupancyUnit': 0.8341 (Strong positive correlation)
    2.  'bathrooms' and 'BathroomBedroomRatio': 0.7474 (Strong positive correlation)
    3.  'price' and 'area': 0.5360 (Moderate positive correlation)
- **Visualizations:** Distribution of 'price' was visualized, a correlation heatmap for all numeric features was generated, and box plots were used for outlier detection.

## Statistical Results
- **Normality Test (price):** The p-value for the normality test on 'price' is 0.0000. This low p-value indicates that the distribution of `price` is significantly non-normal.
- **Correlation Test (price vs area):** The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between 'price' and 'area' is 0.5360, with a p-value of 0.0000. This indicates a statistically significant moderate positive linear relationship between house price and area.
- **Group Comparison:** The analysis indicated that there were not enough suitable columns to perform a group comparison test as per the defined criteria.

## Recommendations
- **Target Variable Transformation:** Given the non-normal distribution of the `price` target variable, consider applying transformations such as a log transform to achieve a more normal distribution, which can improve the performance of some regression models.
- **Feature Selection/Engineering:** Focus on features with strong correlations to `price`, such as `area` and `bathrooms`. Further investigate the derived features (`AreaPerOccupancyUnit`, `BathroomBedroomRatio`) for their individual contributions and potential multicollinearity with their parent features.
- **Multicollinearity Check:** Address potential multicollinearity, especially between highly correlated pairs like `area` and `AreaPerOccupancyUnit`, and `bathrooms` and `BathroomBedroomRatio`. This may involve feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques.
- **Model Selection:** Begin with linear regression models to establish a baseline, then explore more robust models like Ridge, Lasso, or tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) which are less sensitive to feature distributions.
- **Outlier Treatment:** Given that outlier detection charts were generated, further investigation and potential treatment of outliers in key features (like `price` and `area`) might be beneficial for model robustness.
