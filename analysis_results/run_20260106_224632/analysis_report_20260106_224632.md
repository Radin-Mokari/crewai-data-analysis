# Executive Summary
The dataset, initially comprising 545 rows and 13 columns, was found to be free of missing values and duplicates. After comprehensive data preparation including feature engineering, the dataset is well-structured with 16 features, indicating readiness for machine learning. Key findings reveal strong correlations between housing price and area, bathrooms, and newly engineered interaction features, which are critical for predictive modeling.

## Data Overview
The raw dataset `df_raw` consists of 545 rows and 13 columns, comprising 6 numeric and 7 categorical features. The target variable is `price`. After cleaning, standardization, one-hot encoding, and feature engineering, the `df_features` DataFrame for analysis has a shape of (545, 16), with all features being numeric.

## Data Quality & Cleaning
*   **Initial State:** The `df_raw` DataFrame was found to have no missing values and no duplicate rows across all 13 columns.
*   **Cleaning Steps:**
    *   A `df_clean` DataFrame was created as a copy of `df_raw`. Although not strictly necessary due to the absence of initial issues, missing values in numeric columns were conceptually imputed with medians and categorical with modes, and duplicate rows were dropped.
    *   The `df_features` DataFrame was prepared from `df_clean`.
    *   Numeric columns (`price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`) were standardized using `StandardScaler`.
    *   Categorical columns (`mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`) were one-hot encoded.
    *   Two derived interaction features, `price_x_area` and `price_div_area`, were engineered from original numeric columns and subsequently scaled.

## Key Findings
*   **Top Absolute Correlations with Price:**
    *   `price` - `price_x_area`: 0.8559 (Strong positive)
    *   `price` - `area`: 0.5360 (Moderate positive)
    *   `price` - `bathrooms`: 0.5175 (Moderate positive)
    *   `price` - `stories`: 0.4207 (Moderate positive)
    *   `price` - `price_div_area`: 0.3929 (Moderate positive)
*   **Other Notable Correlations:**
    *   `area` - `price_x_area`: 0.8537 (Strong positive)
    *   `area` - `price_div_area`: -0.4655 (Moderate negative)
*   **Observed Patterns:**
    *   The engineered feature `price_x_area` exhibits the strongest positive correlation with `price` and `area`, suggesting its high predictive power.
    *   `price_div_area` shows a strong negative correlation with `area` but a moderate positive one with `price`.
    *   Features like `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, and `parking` consistently show positive correlations with `price`, indicating that larger, more equipped houses command higher prices.
*   **Anomalies:** Box plots were generated for outlier detection on numeric columns; however, specific outlier details are not provided in the analysis results.

## Statistical Results
*   **Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk for 'price'):**
    *   **Variables:** `price`
    *   **Statistic:** 0.9216
    *   **p-value:** 0.0000
    *   **Interpretation:** With a p-value much less than 0.05, the null hypothesis of normality for the 'price' distribution is rejected. 'price' is not normally distributed.
*   **Correlation Test (Pearson for 'price' vs 'area'):**
    *   **Variables:** `price`, `area`
    *   **r-value:** 0.5360
    *   **p-value:** 0.0000
    *   **Interpretation:** A strong positive and statistically significant linear relationship exists between 'price' and 'area'.
*   **Group Comparison (Kruskal-Wallis for 'price' by 'mainroad'):**
    *   **Variables:** `price` grouped by `mainroad`
    *   **p-value:** 0.0000
    *   **Interpretation:** With a p-value less than 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference in the median 'price' between houses located on a main road versus those not.

## Recommendations
*   **Model Selection:** Given the non-normal distribution of the target variable `price` and strong linear/non-linear relationships, explore robust regression models or tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
*   **Feature Importance:** Prioritize features with high correlations, especially the engineered interaction terms (`price_x_area`, `price_div_area`), during model training.
*   **Categorical Impact:** Further investigate the impact of categorical variables that showed significant differences (e.g., `mainroad`) using feature importance techniques or specific encoding strategies.
*   **Outlier Handling:** Review the generated box plots for significant outliers and consider strategies for handling them if they might negatively impact model performance.
*   **Next Steps:** Proceed with model training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning using the `df_features` DataFrame.
