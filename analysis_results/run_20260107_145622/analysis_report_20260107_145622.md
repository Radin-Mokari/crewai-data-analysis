# Executive Summary
The initial dataset comprised 1301 rows and 10 columns, with several missing values and one duplicate row. Following a comprehensive cleaning process, which included imputation, duplicate removal, type conversion, and feature engineering, the dataset was transformed into `df_features` with 1300 rows and 10 columns, prepared for machine learning. Key findings reveal strong correlations between engineered features and original variables, with `pclass` showing a significant negative correlation with `survived`.

## Data Overview
The raw dataset (`df_raw`) contained 1301 rows and 10 columns. Numeric columns identified were 'sn', 'pclass', 'survived', and 'family', while categorical columns included 'Unnamed: 3', 'gender', 'age', 'fare', 'embarked', and 'date'. The target variable is 'survived'. After preprocessing, the `df_features` DataFrame consists of 1300 rows and 10 columns, with numeric features such as 'pclass', 'survived', 'age', 'family', 'fare', 'family_size', and 'age_fare_interaction', and one-hot encoded categorical features for 'gender' and 'embarked'.

## Data Quality & Cleaning
Initial data quality issues included:
*   Missing values: 'age' (257), 'embarked' (6), 'gender' (1), 'family' (2), 'fare' (2).
*   One duplicate row.
*   Incorrect data types for 'age' and 'fare' (initially `object`).

Cleaning steps applied:
*   Missing numerical values in 'family' were imputed using the median.
*   Missing categorical values in 'gender', 'age', 'fare', and 'embarked' were imputed using their respective modes.
*   The duplicate row was removed.
*   Irrelevant columns ('Unnamed: 3', 'date', 'sn') were dropped.
*   'age' and 'fare' columns were converted to numeric types.
*   Two new features were engineered: 'family_size' and 'age_fare_interaction'.
*   All numeric columns were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
*   Categorical features ('gender', 'embarked') were one-hot encoded.

## Key Findings
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** After scaling, all numeric features in `df_features` exhibit a mean close to 0 and a standard deviation close to 1, with varying min/max ranges.
*   **Top 3 Absolute Correlations:**
    1.  'family' and 'family_size': 1.0000 (Positive correlation), indicating 'family_size' is directly derived from 'family'.
    2.  'age_fare_interaction' and 'fare': 0.9080 (Positive correlation), suggesting a strong relationship between fare and the interaction term.
    3.  'fare' and 'pclass': -0.5577 (Negative correlation), showing that higher passenger classes (lower numerical value) are associated with higher fares.
*   **EDA Insights (Implied from generated charts):**
    *   Highly skewed columns like 'family' and 'fare' suggest a need to consider their distributions carefully for modeling.
    *   The distribution of 'age' likely varies between survivors and non-survivors, indicating its importance.
    *   A clear relationship exists between 'fare', 'pclass', and 'survived', where lower `pclass` and higher `fare` generally correlate with increased survival rates.
    *   Survival rates show differences across 'gender' and 'embarked' categories.

## Statistical Results
*   **Normality Test (pclass):**
    *   Statistic = 0.7254, p-value = 0.0000.
    *   Interpretation: The p-value is less than 0.05, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. Data for 'pclass' is likely not normally distributed.
*   **Correlation Test (pclass vs survived):**
    *   r = -0.3087, p-value = 0.0000.
    *   Interpretation: The p-value is less than 0.05, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. There is a statistically significant negative linear correlation between 'pclass' and 'survived'.

## Recommendations
*   Proceed with machine learning model training using the `df_features` DataFrame, as it is scaled and encoded.
*   Consider evaluating various classification models, given 'survived' is a binary target variable.
*   Perform feature importance analysis to identify the most impactful features for the 'survived' outcome.
*   Investigate the impact of outliers in highly skewed features ('family', 'fare') on model performance.
*   Explore non-linear models or transformation techniques for non-normally distributed features if initial linear models underperform.
