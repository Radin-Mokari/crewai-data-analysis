# Executive Summary
The dataset, initially comprising 62,988 records and 23 columns, underwent extensive cleaning and feature engineering, addressing missing values and creating new interaction features. Analysis revealed strong positive correlations among key customer activity metrics and spending, indicating robust relationships crucial for customer segmentation. The data is now prepared for machine learning, with scaled numerical features and one-hot encoded categorical variables, making it suitable for clustering or predictive modeling tasks.

## Data Overview
The raw dataset `df_raw` contains 62,988 rows and 23 columns.
- **Numeric columns**: `MEMBER_NO`, `FFP_TIER`, `AGE`, `FLIGHT_COUNT`, `BP_SUM`, `SUM_YR_1`, `SUM_YR_2`, `SEG_KM_SUM`, `LAST_TO_END`, `AVG_INTERVAL`, `MAX_INTERVAL`, `EXCHANGE_COUNT`, `avg_discount`, `Points_Sum`, `Point_NotFlight`.
- **Categorical columns**: `FFP_DATE`, `FIRST_FLIGHT_DATE`, `GENDER`, `WORK_CITY`, `WORK_PROVINCE`, `WORK_COUNTRY`, `LOAD_TIME`, `LAST_FLIGHT_DATE`.
- A direct target variable is not explicitly identified, but `BP_SUM`, `Points_Sum`, `TOTAL_SPENT` are potential variables for customer value analysis.

## Data Quality & Cleaning
- **Missing Values**:
    - Numeric columns like 'AGE', 'SUM_YR_1', and 'SUM_YR_2' had missing values.
    - Categorical columns such as 'GENDER', 'WORK_CITY', 'WORK_PROVINCE', and 'WORK_COUNTRY' also contained missing entries.
- **Duplicate Rows**: No duplicate rows were found in the raw dataset.
- **Cleaning Steps**:
    - Missing numeric values were imputed with their respective medians.
    - Missing categorical values were filled with their modes.
    - Duplicate rows were confirmed not to exist, so no removal was necessary.
- **Feature Engineering**:
    - Numerical columns were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    - Categorical columns were one-hot encoded.
    - Two new features were derived:
        - `SUM_YR_PRODUCT`: Interaction of `SUM_YR_1` and `SUM_YR_2`.
        - `TOTAL_SPENT`: Sum of `SUM_YR_1` and `SUM_YR_2`.

## Key Findings
- **High Skewness**: `BP_SUM` exhibits significant skewness and numerous outliers, indicating a distribution heavily weighted towards lower values with a long tail of high-value customers. This suggests a need for transformation or robust models.
- **Strong Positive Correlations**:
    - `TOTAL_SPENT` shows a very strong positive correlation with `BP_SUM` (0.9513).
    - `BP_SUM` is highly correlated with `Points_Sum` (0.9233).
    - `SEG_KM_SUM` also has a high correlation with `BP_SUM` (0.9217).
    - Generally, activity-related metrics (`FLIGHT_COUNT`, `SEG_KM_SUM`, `BP_SUM`, `Points_Sum`, `SUM_YR_1`, `SUM_YR_2`) are strongly intercorrelated, indicating that customers active in one aspect tend to be active in others.
- **Relationship between Spending and Points**: A clear positive linear relationship exists between `BP_SUM` and `Points_Sum`, consistent across gender, suggesting that higher bonus points are directly linked to higher total points accumulation.
- **Gender and Spending**: Violin plots indicated potential differences in the distribution, spread, and density of `TOTAL_SPENT` between male and female customers, warranting further investigation into gender-specific spending patterns.

## Statistical Results
- **Normality Test on `MEMBER_NO` (Shapiro-Wilk Test)**:
    - **Result**: p-value = 0.0000
    - **Interpretation**: `MEMBER_NO` is not normally distributed, which is expected for an identifier variable.
- **Correlation Test between `MEMBER_NO` and `FFP_TIER` (Pearson Correlation Coefficient)**:
    - **Result**: r = -0.0059, p-value = 0.1380
    - **Interpretation**: No statistically significant linear correlation was found between `MEMBER_NO` and `FFP_TIER`, as anticipated for an identifier.
- **Group Comparison (Kruskal-Wallis Test)**:
    - **Result**: "Not enough categorical or numeric columns available for Group Comparison."
    - **Interpretation**: This test could not be performed due to the transformation of all original categorical columns into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoded binary columns) within `df_features`, which left no columns of 'object' or 'category' data type.

## Recommendations
- **Clustering**: Proceed with customer segmentation using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) on the `df_features` DataFrame to identify distinct customer groups based on their flight activity, spending, and points accumulation.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Explore predictive models for customer lifetime value (CLV) or churn prediction using the engineered features. The strong correlations observed suggest that `FLIGHT_COUNT`, `SEG_KM_SUM`, `BP_SUM`, `Points_Sum`, `SUM_YR_PRODUCT`, and `TOTAL_SPENT` will be influential predictors.
- **Feature Transformation**: Consider applying log transformations or other power transformations to highly skewed variables like `BP_SUM` if parametric models are to be used, to better meet model assumptions.
- **Deep Dive into Gender Differences**: Further analyze the differences in `TOTAL_SPENT` and other key metrics across genders to identify specific marketing or service opportunities.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Given the presence of yearly sum features (`SUM_YR_1`, `SUM_YR_2`), explore time-series aspects if historical data granularity allows, to understand customer evolution over time.
